### 6. Add Your PDF Files

Place these files in the same directory:
- `paper.pdf` - Your job market paper
- `cv.pdf` - Your curriculum vitae
- Any additional working paper PDFs mentioned in the HTML

### 7. Add Paper Images (Optional but Recommended)

Add visual elements to make your papers stand out:
- `paper-image.jpg` - An image for your job market paper (e.g., key figure, chart, or diagram from the paper)
- `working-paper-1-image.jpg` - Image for working paper 1
- `working-paper-2-image.jpg` - Image for working paper 2

**Image Guidelines:**
- **Recommended source size**: 400x300 pixels (or similar 4:3 ratio) for job market paper, 240x180 pixels for working papers
- **Display size**: Images will be displayed at 200px width for job market paper and 120px width for working papers, scaled proportionally
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Content ideas**: Key graphs, charts, maps, or visual summaries from your research
- **Tip**: Export a key figure from your paper at high resolution (2x the display size for retina screens) and crop appropriately

If you don't want to include images, you can remove the image elements from the HTML or leave the placeholders - they will show broken image icons which users can ignore.
