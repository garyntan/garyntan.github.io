        This paper studies the labour market effects of funding for disability-related
        supports, using evidence from the large-scale roll-out of Australia’s National
        Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Leveraging a staggered difference-in-differences design, I find that the reform on average increased affected participants’
        total annual earnings by 11.1% of the pre-treatment outcome in the four years
        following exposure. Receipt of income-replacement benefits declined, consistent
        with the findings on increased earnings. The labour market effects, however, are
        highly heterogeneous: earnings gains are driven almost entirely by participants
        with prior labour force attachment, while those with no employment history
        remain unaffected. Using a novel administrative dataset on granular funding
        allocations and NDIS survey outcomes, I provide evidence that the NDIS in-
        creased economic participation primarily through indirect channels such as by
        reducing care constraints and increasing autonomy, rather than through direct
        channels such as employment or training programmes.

                <p>
                    Hello! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Zurich, specialising in applied microeconomics.
                    My research encompasses topics in labour economics, health economics and public policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                   During the 2024/25 academic year I visited the Department of Economics at The University of Melbourne. 
                   I hold an MSc in Economics from the University of Amsterdam and have worked at the OECD, De Nederlandsche Bank (the Dutch central bank) and the Australian Department of Jobs. 
                   In another life, I worked as a community pharmacist - I also hold a BSc in Pharmacy from Monash University.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>I am on the 2025/26 job market.</strong>

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Using a decomposition of US monetary policy shocks and inflation forecasts from Consensus Economics, we find that information and monetary policy shocks move inflation expectations in opposite directions. Better performing forecasters appear less reliant on the informational content of announcements.<br>

                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naomi Clarke, Clare Dyer, Salvador Amara, Susana Vaz Nery, and Garyn Tan<br>
                    <strong>Published in:</strong> International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health (2021)<br>
                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Open defecation (OD) is still a significant public health challenge worldwide. In Timor-Leste, where an estimated 20% of the population practiced OD in 2017, increasing access and use of improved sanitation facilities is a government priority. Community-led total sanitation (CLTS) has become a popular strategy to end OD since its inception in 2000, but evidence on the uptake of CLTS and related interventions and the long-term sustainability of OD-free (ODF) communities is limited. This study utilized a mixed-methods approach, encompassing quantitative monitoring and evaluation data from water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) agencies, and semi-structured interviews with staff working for these organizations and the government Department of Environmental Health, to examine sanitation interventions in Timor-Leste. Recommendations from WASH practitioners on how sanitation strategies can be optimized to ensure ODF sustainability are presented. Whilst uptake of interventions is generally good in Timor-Leste, lack of consistent monitoring and evaluation following intervention delivery may contribute to the observed slippage back to OD practices. Stakeholder views suggest that long-term support and monitoring after ODF certification are needed to sustain ODF communities.<br>

                    <h4>Beyond the Zero Lower Bound: Negative Policy Rates and Bank Lending</h4>
                    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Garyn Tan<br>
                    <strong>Published in:</strong> DNB Working Paper, De Nederlandsche Bank (2019)<br>
                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> How do banks operate in a negative policy rate environment? Bank profitability is threatened by policy rate cuts in negative territory because the zero lower bound on retail deposit rates prevents banks from benefiting from cheaper deposit funding costs. Contrary to some earlier research, this paper finds that banks most affected by negative rates through this retail deposits channel increase their lending relative to less affected banks. The response is limited to mortgage lending, and is driven by banks with high household deposit ratios and banks with high overnight deposit ratios. Overall, net interest margins are unaffected, which implies that the volume effect is large enough to offset the adverse impact on bank profitability. However, the positive effect on lending dissipates as negative rates persist. This suggests that although the" reversal rate" has not been breached, it may creep up over time as banks become more limited in their options to maintain profit margins. The results also point to an important role for bank capitalisation–net interest margins of relatively highly capitalised banks are squeezed, whereas the net interest margins of less capitalised banks are unaffected. This can be explained by differences in capacity for shock absorbency.<br>
