                    <p>
        This paper studies the labour market effects of funding for disability-related
        supports, using evidence from the large-scale roll-out of Australia’s National
        Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Leveraging a staggered difference-in-dif-
        ferences design, I find that the reform on average increased affected participants’
        total annual earnings by 11.1% of the pre-treatment outcome in the four years
        following exposure. Receipt of income-replacement benefits declined, consistent
        with the findings on increased earnings. The labour market effects, however, are
        highly heterogeneous: earnings gains are driven almost entirely by participants
        with prior labour force attachment, while those with no employment history
        remain unaffected. Using a novel administrative dataset on granular funding
        allocations and NDIS survey outcomes, I provide evidence that the NDIS in-
        creased economic participation primarily through indirect channels such as by
        reducing care constraints and increasing autonomy, rather than through direct
        channels such as employment or training programmes.
