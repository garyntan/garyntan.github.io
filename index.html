        This paper studies the labour market effects of funding for disability-related
        supports, using evidence from the large-scale roll-out of Australia’s National
        Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Leveraging a staggered difference-in-differences design, I find that the reform on average increased affected participants’
        total annual earnings by 11.1% of the pre-treatment outcome in the four years
        following exposure. Receipt of income-replacement benefits declined, consistent
        with the findings on increased earnings. The labour market effects, however, are
        highly heterogeneous: earnings gains are driven almost entirely by participants
        with prior labour force attachment, while those with no employment history
        remain unaffected. Using a novel administrative dataset on granular funding
        allocations and NDIS survey outcomes, I provide evidence that the NDIS in-
        creased economic participation primarily through indirect channels such as by
        reducing care constraints and increasing autonomy, rather than through direct
        channels such as employment or training programmes.

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Zurich, specialising in applied microeconomics.
                    My research encompasses topics in labour economics, health economics and public policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                   During the 2024/25 academic year I visited the Department of Economics at The University of Melbourne. 
                   I hold an MSc in Economics from the University of Amsterdam and have worked at the OECD, De Nederlandsche Bank (the Dutch central bank) and the Australian Department of Jobs. 
                   In another life, I worked as a community pharmacist - I also hold a BSc in Pharmacy from Monash University.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>I am on the 2025/26 job market.</strong>
